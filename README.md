This software uses space-age Python coding techniques to solve the ever-
difficult problem facing grad students on a daily basis: where to eat lunch.

Features:

* Solves the problem of where to eat lunch in O(n)!
* Modify your .lunchrc to include favorite places to eat!
* Written in one line of Python (like most things worth doing)!
* Includes long bullet point lists with exclamation points!

Add entries to $HOME/.lunchrc (one per line).
